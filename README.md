# 🎡 Roulette CLI Game (Go)

A fully interactive **command-line roulette game** built in Go.  
This project simulates a European roulette wheel with multiple bet types, a visual table display, color-coded results, and balance tracking — all in a simple, text-based interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple bet types**:
  - Straight (single number)
  - Red/Black
  - Odd/Even
  - Low/High (1–18 / 19–36)
  - Dozens (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - Columns (Col1, Col2, Col3)
- **Accurate European roulette colors & payouts**
- **Animated wheel spin** showing number sequence
- **Color-coded results** in the terminal
- **ASCII roulette table** for easy reference before betting
- Tracks **player balance** and ends the game when funds run out
- Supports **multiple bets in one round**
- Fully **tested** core game logic (`roulette_test.go`)
